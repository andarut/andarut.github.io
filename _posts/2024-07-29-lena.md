Many compranies nowadays using codecs. For streaming, for video hosting, etc. There are much more data each year. Some companies, for example, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Apple and others create they are own codecs for their needs. So how you can see developing progress, know that you codec is getting better, and how good is others codecs? 

So, as a developer (how don't know much about codecs), you can perform local tests for diffrent codecs and select best for your case.

As a codec developer(s), you can seeing how your codec is improving with new features and bugfixes.

As a non developer person, you can get simple numbers. Not large dataset with different parameters, just general score. Like a acceleration to 100. There are different roads and environments, but with this simple score you can tell your general opinion on car.
